# webdriver-execute-automation

This project was created to automate acceptance testing for a web application. We used Cypress, a UI automated testing framework, to automate critical workflows of the web application.

We also used other tools and technologies in my project, including:

1.**Cypress Test Runner**: A user interface tool used for writing, debugging and running tests in a browser.
2.**Cucumber**: A tool for behavior-driven development (BDD) that allows writing test scenarios in natural language syntax.
3.**Mocha and Chai**: Testing frameworks used in Cypress for writing test scripts and assertions.
