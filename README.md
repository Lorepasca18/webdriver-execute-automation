# webdriver-execute-automation

This project was created to automate acceptance testing for a web application. We used Cypress, a UI automated testing framework, to automate critical workflows of the web application.

We also used other tools and technologies in my project, including:

1.GitHub: a Git project hosting service that provides version control, issue tracking, and team collaboration.
2.Cypress Test Runner: A user interface tool used for writing, debugging and running tests in a browser.
3.Cucumber: A tool for behavior-driven development (BDD) that allows writing test scenarios in natural language syntax.
4.Mocha and Chai: Testing frameworks used in Cypress for writing test scripts and assertions.
